# electron-game
Testing if electron is a good platform for html5 games. Who knows? Maybe it won't be great but let's find out what can be done.

## :warning: Nothing to see here as of now :warning:

Will remove this notice when there actually is a small game and some steamworks integration.

## TODOs

- [ ] :space_invader: Add some kind of game (probably 2D)
- [ ] :video_game: Implement and test gamepad compability
- [ ] :green_circle: Implement steamworks.js and check if steam overlay works
- [ ] :sparkle: Test three.js and/or babylon.js

## Test platforms
- :deer: Ubuntu 22.10 (yes, I should upgrade) with various game controllers
- :green_circle: Steam Deck with built in controller and touch screen
- :apple: macOS with various game controllers

- [Game Dev Tycoon Credits](https://www.greenheartgames.com/credits/game-dev-tycoon/) - Famously using [node-webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) for their game. I guess [CrossCode](http://www.cross-code.com/en/home) should be mentioned too.
